# Home_Sales
This is Module 22 challenge for Data Analytics Bootcamp. The assignment was to use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data, and then use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.
The main codes are under Home_Sales_colab.ipynb and I used Google Colaboratory.
